*Writen with AI to use as an example

As we near the end of 2025, I’ve finally settled into a desk configuration that feels completely dialed in. Over the years, I've oscillated between maxing out specs and trying to work off just a laptop. This year, I found the perfect middle ground: a powerful desktop tower housed in an intentionally calm, minimalist environment.

For me, a cluttered desk leads to a cluttered mind. My current setup is focused on keeping distractions to a minimum so I can stay in the flow state.

## The Aesthetic Philosophy

My workspace is dominated by white. It reflects light well and makes the room feel open.

While the trend for years has been aggressive RGB lighting, I’ve taken a step back. My tower is capable of lighting up the room, but 99% of the time, the RGB is turned completely off. I want my code on the screen to be the only thing drawing my eye, not blinking lights in my peripheral vision. The desk surface remains aggressively clutter-free—everything has a home, and that home is usually inside a drawer.

## The Engine Room (The Tower)

I’m not chasing the absolute bleeding edge of hardware releases. I prefer components with proven reliability and an excellent price-to-performance ratio. My current build handles heavy development stacks, compiling, and occasional gaming without breaking a sweat.

* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 5600X. Even in 2025, this 6-core chip is an absolute workhorse for multitasking.
* **GPU:** Radeon RX 6600 OC. More than enough power to drive multiple displays smoothly and handle any graphical workloads I throw at it.
* **RAM:** 16GB. The sweet spot for my current development needs.

## The Visuals (Dual Monitors)

I’ve tried ultrawides, but I keep coming back to a reliable dual-monitor setup for distinct window management.

* **Primary Display:** A **Gigabyte 27-inch** panel running at **180Hz**. It’s incredibly smooth. Once you get used to high refresh rates just for moving windows and scrolling through code, it’s painful to go back to 60Hz. This is where my IDE lives.
* **Secondary Display:** A **Philips 24-inch (75Hz)** housed off to the side. This is dedicated to documentation, terminal output, Slack, or Spotify.

## The Tactile Experience

Because I spend my entire day typing, the keyboard is crucial.

I’m currently using the **BlitzWolf BW-KB1**. It’s a mechanical keyboard that hits the right balance for me. It provides that satisfying tactile feedback you need for long coding sessions without being obnoxiously loud, and its compact footprint fits perfectly with the minimalist desk vibe.

This setup isn't about showing off; it's about getting work done efficiently in a space that feels good to be in.
