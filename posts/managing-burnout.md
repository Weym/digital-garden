**Writen with AI to use as an example**

Last month, I sat down to fix a simple CSS bug. It was a padding issue—something that should have taken five minutes. Two hours later, I was staring blankly at the screen, feeling a level of exhaustion that sleep couldn't fix.

I wasn't tired; I was burnt out.

In the tech industry, we often wear exhaustion as a badge of honor. We glorify the "grind," the side hustles, and the green GitHub contribution graphs. But after pushing myself too hard for too long, I've learned a hard truth: **You cannot code your way out of burnout.**

## The "Always On" Trap

As developers, our hobbies often look exactly like our work. We write code for work, then we come home and read about code, listen to podcasts about code, or work on side projects involving... code.

This lack of separation creates a cognitive tunnel. Your brain never actually switches context. It stays in problem-solving mode 24/7.

The pressure to keep up is immense. New frameworks pop up every week. If you aren't learning the newest JS library, are you falling behind? This fear of missing out (FOMO) drives us to stay online long after the workday ends.

## Rest is an Engineering Problem

If you treat your body like a server, you have to account for downtime. If a server runs at 100% CPU usage for weeks on end, it crashes. Humans are no different.

I used to think that taking time off was "lost productivity." I realized later that **rest is actually a dependency for quality code.**

When I am burnt out, my code is sloppy. I introduce bugs. I make bad architectural decisions. When I am rested, I can solve in 10 minutes what used to take me 3 hours of brute-force staring.

## How I Reclaimed My Sanity

Recovering from burnout (and preventing it) required me to make intentional changes to my setup and my routine.

### 1. Analog Hobbies
I realized I needed hobbies that didn't involve a screen or a logic gate. I started doing things that required physical movement or tangible results. Cooking, hiking, or even just cleaning the house. These activities use a different part of the brain and allow the "coding" part to recharge.

### 2. The Notification Purge
I turned off push notifications for everything except direct phone calls. No Slack on the phone. No email pings after 6 PM. If it is a true emergency, someone will call. (Spoiler: It is almost never a true emergency).

### 3. Protecting Weekends
I stopped coding on weekends. This was hard at first—I felt guilty, like I was losing my "edge." But by Monday morning, I actually felt excited to open my IDE again, rather than dreading it.

## It's Okay to Be Offline

If you are reading this and feeling that familiar brain fog, close the laptop. The bug will still be there tomorrow. The framework will still be there next week.

Your mental health is the most critical piece of hardware you own. Maintain it.
